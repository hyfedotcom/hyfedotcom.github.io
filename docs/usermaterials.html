<h2 id="informed-consent-template">Informed Consent Template</h2>
<p>The ICF provides participants with essential information about the
study, including its purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, privacy
protections, and voluntary nature. It explains that the Hyfe
CoughMonitor Suite detects coughs using short sound signatures without
storing audio, ensuring privacy. The document outlines participant
rights, data confidentiality, data storage practices, and conditions for
withdrawal. A second section contains the formal consent certificate,
with signature fields, witness options for illiterate participants, and
a researcher attestation confirming proper explanation and voluntary
participation.</p>

<h2 id="participant-brochure">Participant brochure</h2>
<p>This brochure introduces participants to the CoughMonitor Suite,
including the watch, mobile Companion app, and device components. It
provides instructions on wearing the watch daily, charging it nightly
within 3 feet of the participant, checking data sync, and
troubleshooting common issues such as reconnection steps when the watch
appears disconnected. The brochure also explains environmental
limitations (temperature, water exposure), how to return the device at
study completion, and how to close the app when needed for
troubleshooting.</p>

brochure</a></p>
<h2 id="site-manual">Site manual</h2>
<p>The comprehensive Site Manual provides full operational details for
research teams using the CoughMonitor Suite. It includes device
specifications, safety and cleaning guidance, software update processes,
and step-by-step procedures for enrollment, pairing, monitoring,
troubleshooting, and ending sessions. It outlines participant
instructions for both daytime and nighttime use, data synchronization
workflows, and escalation steps for technical issues. The manual also
includes processes for submitting Data Correction Forms and for
returning equipment, serving as the primary reference for consistent
study operations.</p>

<h2 id="site-online-training-manual">Site online training manual</h2>
<p>These visual mini-guides give site staff quick-reference instructions
for starting, managing, and ending a cough monitoring session. They
cover operating the CoughMonitor (battery, proximity, screen lock),
enrolling participants through the dashboard, pairing the watch with the
Companion app, and confirming data synchronization. Additional sections
explain how to monitor syncing, respond to alerts when data has not
synced for 36 hours, support participants with diary completion, and
execute proper steps for session termination and device unpairing.</p>
