<h1 id="effect-of-garment-obstructionmuffling-on-cough-detection">Effect
of garment obstruction/muffling on cough detection</h1>
<p>Garment type can systematically influence the performance of
wrist-worn <strong>acoustic</strong> cough detection systems because
clothing alters the transmission, attenuation, and contamination of
body-borne acoustic energy. Clothing disrupts this pathway in several
well-defined ways.</p>
<h2 id="garment-generated-acoustic-artefacts">1. Garment-Generated
Acoustic Artefacts</h2>
<p>Sleeves in motion generate their own <strong>contact-acoustic
noise</strong>, including frictional rubbing, fabric snapping, and
rustling.</p>
<ul>
<li>These garment-borne vibrations can be transmitted to the device
through direct contact or through transient pressure changes.</li>
<li>Such artefacts can occupy the same frequency ranges as body-borne
cough vibrations, increasing the risk of both false positives (artefacts
mistaken for coughs) and false negatives (true coughs masked by
noise).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-in-sensor-coupling-and-fit">2. Changes in Sensor
Coupling and Fit</h2>
<p>Although the sensing mechanism is acoustic, the <strong>quality of
mechanical–acoustic coupling</strong> between the device and wrist
strongly determines signal fidelity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different garment types (tight cuffs, elastic sleeves, bulky
sweaters) can slightly reposition the device or vary the contact
pressure against the skin.</li>
<li>Variability in coupling leads to inconsistent acoustic transmission
paths and reduced reproducibility of cough signatures across
conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="muffling-obstruction">3. Muffling / Obstruction</h2>
<p>Garments can form a physical barrier between which obstructs the
microphone, obstructing the signal.</p>

id="hyfes-experiments-to-quantify-garment-related-acoustic-interference">Hyfe’s
Experiments to Quantify Garment-Related Acoustic Interference</h1>
<p>Hyfe is planning a structured set of <strong>three
experiments</strong>, all focused on quantifying how clothing affects
<strong>acoustic</strong> pathways and algorithmic performance. These
experiments will take place during Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.</p>
<h2
id="experiment-1-bench-top-acoustic-transmission-study"><strong>Experiment
1: Bench-Top Acoustic Transmission Study</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Characterize how different fabrics and
sleeve configurations modify the <strong>acoustic transmission</strong>
of cough-like signals from a simulated wrist.</p>
<p><strong>Design Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use an <strong>instrumented wrist phantom</strong> or rigid
fixture that receives standardised cough-like acoustic inputs (e.g., via
a mini-shaker or speaker generating a canonical cough
waveform).</p></li>
<li><p>Apply controlled garment conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fabric type (cotton, wool, fleece, polyester, denim)</li>
<li>Sleeve tightness (tight, regular, loose)</li>
<li>Layer count (bare, single layer, multi-layer).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Record waveform attenuation, spectral distortion, and noise
generated by fabric movement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This isolates the <em>acoustic</em>
effects of clothing without human variability, establishing baseline
attenuation and noise profiles for different garment types.</p>
<h2
id="experiment-2-controlled-human-study-with-standardised-garments"><strong>Experiment
2: Controlled Human Study With Standardised Garments</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Quantitatively assess how clothing
impacts <strong>acoustic cough detection performance</strong> in a
controlled human environment.</p>
<p><strong>Design Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants wear the Hyfe wrist-worn acoustic cough monitor
under several garment conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bare wrist</li>
<li>Light long sleeve (tight and loose)</li>
<li>Sweater/hoodie</li>
<li>Jacket/outerwear</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Each participant performs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardised voluntary coughs (for precisely labelled acoustic
ground truth)</li>
<li>Controlled movements (sitting, walking, arm swings) to elicit
garment-noise artefacts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ground truth provided by synchronised high-quality audio or
expert annotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity/specificity under each garment condition</li>
<li>Changes in acoustic feature distributions (e.g., band-limited
energy, spectral centroid, waveform envelope).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This links garment-induced acoustic
interference to actual algorithmic degradation in a controlled,
reproducible setting.</p>
<h2
id="experiment-3-free-living-field-study-with-garment-logging"><strong>Experiment
3: Free-Living Field Study With Garment Logging</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Determine the real-world impact of
garment type on wrist-based acoustic cough monitoring under natural
behaviour and environments.</p>
<p><strong>Design Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants wear the device continuously for multiple
days/weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Garment state is logged through a smartphone interface (bare
wrist, light sleeve, heavy sleeve, jacket, etc.), with optional
time-stamped photographs to enhance accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>A subset may wear a second, chest-mounted acoustic cough monitor
or provide audio-based ground truth for periodic validation.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithmic metrics stratified by garment type</li>
<li>How daily contexts interact with clothing to affect acoustic
SNR</li>
<li>Whether garment-aware models or preprocessing restore
performance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This assesses ecological validity: it
quantifies how much acoustic interference clothing actually produces in
everyday use and informs mitigation strategies.</p>
