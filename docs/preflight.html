Microphone Verification: Controlled Playback, Ambient-Noise Robustness,
and Test-Rig Evaluation</h1>
<p>Prior to deployment in research or production environments, Hyfe
performs pre-flight microphone verification testing to ensure that each
device’s acoustic sensing pathway meets engineering specifications
required for reliable cough-like event capture. These tests are
conducted using a standardized test-rig and controlled acoustic stimuli,
enabling precise, repeatable assessment of microphone functionality
under well-defined conditions. These tests also confirm the proper
functioning of other, non-acoustic components of the device, including
those pertaining to connectivity, display, data transmission, battery,
and logging. The objective of the pre-flight process is to validate that
the sensors can faithfully record cough-like impulsive sounds and
maintain performance in the presence of expected environmental noise,
thereby confirming their readiness for field use.</p>
<h2 id="controlled-playback-of-cough-like-acoustic-stimuli">Controlled
Playback of Cough-Like Acoustic Stimuli</h2>
<p>The core component of the pre-flight protocol involves exposing
devices to synthetic cough-like audio events played through a calibrated
loudspeaker system. The stimuli emulate the broadband impulsive spectral
characteristics of human coughs, including rapid onset, short duration,
and multi-frequency content between approximately 100–3,500 Hz. Playback
occurs within an acoustically controlled environment to ensure
consistent delivery of sound energy across repetitions.</p>
<p>During testing, devices are placed in standardized orientations and
distances relative to the source to eliminate spatial variability. Audio
of real-world recorded coughs is played via speakers, and detections are
quantified. Devices that do not fall within range are discarded.</p>
<h2
id="assessment-of-robustness-to-non-cough-acoustic-stimuli">Assessment
of robustness to non-cough acoustic stimuli</h2>
<p>To ensure robustness under realistic environmental conditions, Hyfe
incorporates ambient-noise exposure testing as an integral component of
the pre-flight evaluation. Background noise typical of real-world
settings—such as HVAC hum, distant conversation, and broadband
environmental noise—is introduced at controlled and repeatable
levels.</p>
<p>During this phase, devices are expected to detect a very low number
of coughs (false positives). Devices that do not fall within range are
discarded.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-standardized-acoustic-test-rig">Use of Standardized
Acoustic Test-Rig</h2>
<p>All pre-flight testing is conducted using a standardized test-rig,
engineered to provide consistent, reproducible test conditions and
eliminate operator-dependent variability. The test-rig incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calibrated sound-source alignment for precise acoustic delivery</li>
<li>Controlled environmental settings (acoustic damping)</li>
<li>Automated playback and logging procedures to minimize human
error</li>
</ul>
<p>This standardized infrastructure ensures that the verification
process is traceable, reproducible, and aligned with established
engineering quality practices. The use of a dedicated test-rig
strengthens the reliability of pre-flight assessments and provides
documented evidence that devices meet design specifications prior to use
in research settings.</p>
<h2
id="confirmation-of-compliance-with-engineering-specifications">Confirmation
of Compliance With Engineering Specifications</h2>
<p>Integrating controlled playback, ambient-noise robustness testing,
and test-rig standardization, Hyfe’s pre-flight microphone verification
procedure provides comprehensive confirmation that devices are able to
reliably capture cough-like acoustic events with the fidelity required
for downstream algorithmic processing. Passing these tests demonstrates
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphones perform within defined sensitivity and
frequency-response specifications</li>
<li>Sensors preserve critical acoustic features required for cough
detection</li>
<li>Environmental noise does not meaningfully impair data capture</li>
<li>Devices are suitable for immediate deployment without further
calibration</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Hyfe’s pre-flight microphone verification ensures that
every device undergoes rigorous, standardized testing prior to study
deployment, establishing a high level of confidence in microphone
integrity and acoustic data quality. This process contributes directly
to reliable cough detection performance in real-world and clinical
research environments.</p>
