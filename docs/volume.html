<h1 id="effect-of-volume-on-cough-detection">Effect of volume on cough
detection</h1>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Acoustic cough detection algorithms depend on the reliable capture
audio events, ie vibrations in the air. The effective amplitude of these
vibrations is strongly influenced by the sound pressure level (SPL) of
the cough at the source. Variability in cough volume—between
individuals, within individuals across contexts, and across disease
states—introduces significant challenges for consistent detection.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reduced SNR and Subthreshold Events</li>
</ol>
<p>Coughs vary in amplitude over a broad dynamic range (30–40 dB
within-person differences are common).</p>
<p>Quieter coughs (low SPL) produce weaker mechanical–acoustic energy
transmitted through the air.</p>
<p>These signals may fall near or below the sensor’s noise floor,
yielding a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and making peak detection or
subsequent classification unreliable.</p>
<p>Such subthreshold or low-SNR coughs may be particularly common in
those with small lungs (children), fatigued patients, or individuals
with obstructive lung disease.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Variability in Spectral and Temporal Features</li>
</ol>
<p>Cough SPL affects not only amplitude but also the shape of the
acoustic waveform:</p>
<p>Higher-volume coughs typically exhibit sharper transients, stronger
high-frequency energy, and more distinct multi-phase structure.</p>
<p>Low-volume coughs may appear muted, temporally smeared, or spectrally
compressed.</p>
<p>Algorithms trained on high-SPL events may misclassify low-SPL events
because their feature distributions diverge.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Influence of Context and Physiology</li>
</ol>
<p>Cough loudness is influenced by biological, contextual, and
behavioural factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disease state (e.g., weak, fatigued, or muffled cough in advanced
disease)<br />
</li>
<li>Posture (supine vs upright)<br />
</li>
<li>Voluntary vs reflexive cough<br />
</li>
<li>Social context (ie, intentional muffling or supression to avoid
disruption of others)</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors create systematic SPL variations that can bias
detection if the model does not account for volume.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Interaction With External Noise</li>
</ol>
<p>Low-SPL coughs are more susceptible to masking by environmental or
garment-induced acoustic noise.</p>
<p>In low-amplitude events, even mild artefacts (fabric friction, arm
movement) can dominate the waveform.</p>
<p>This increases false negatives, reduces temporal precision, and
produces uncertainty in classifications.</p>

Experiments to Quantify the Impact of Cough Volume on Acoustic
Detection</h2>
<p>To rigorously characterise how SPL affects wrist-based acoustic cough
detection, a structured set of three experiments—progressing from
controlled acoustic simulations to human studies and free-living
validation—is proposed. This document will be updated upon the
completion of these experiments in Q1 2026.</p>
<h3
id="experiment-1-controlled-human-study-with-standardised-cough-spl">Experiment
1: Controlled Human Study With Standardised Cough SPL</h3>
<p>Objective: Evaluate algorithmic performance across controlled cough
volume levels in human participants.</p>
<p>Design Overview:</p>
<p>Participants perform voluntary coughs instructed to reach specific
SPL bands (e.g., low, medium, high), monitored using a calibrated
near-field microphone or spirometry-coupled cough meter.</p>
<p>Perform coughs across postures (seated, standing) to capture natural
within-person variability.</p>
<p>Collect concurrent wrist acoustic signals and high-quality audio
ground truth.</p>
<p>Analyse:</p>
<p>Sensitivity and precision as a function of SPL</p>
<p>Feature distributions for low vs high SPL events</p>
<p>Misclassification patterns driven by low-SPL coughs.</p>
<p>Rationale: This experiment links SPL-dependent changes in the
acoustic signal to actual algorithmic behaviour, enabling identification
of vulnerability ranges.</p>
<h3
id="experiment-2-free-living-study-with-passive-spl-estimation">Experiment
2: Free-Living Study With Passive SPL Estimation</h3>
<p>Objective: Assess the role of cough volume in real-world wrist-based
detection accuracy.</p>
<p>Design Overview:</p>
<p>Participants wear the wrist device continuously for several days.</p>
<p>A subset uses an auxiliary audio reference (e.g., chest clip
microphone or smartphone cough logger) capable of estimating relative
SPL for labelled events.</p>
<p>Real-world coughs are stratified into SPL categories (e.g., quiet,
moderate, loud) based on reference measurements.</p>
<p>Evaluate:</p>
<p>Detection rates across SPL levels</p>
<p>SPL–SNR interactions with environmental noise and activity</p>
<p>Whether SPL-aware preprocessing (e.g., dynamic gain compensation)
improves detection.</p>
<p>Rationale: This quantifies the extent to which SPL
variability—particularly the prevalence of mild, quiet, or suppressed
coughs—limits performance under ecologically valid conditions.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cough SPL (volume, in decibels) critically shapes the detectability
of body-borne acoustic signatures at the wrist. Low-SPL coughs produce
weak, spectrally altered vibrations that are easily masked by noise and
may fall below detection thresholds, while high-SPL coughs yield
clearer, more discriminable features. The proposed two-stage
experimental programme—controlled human studies with calibrated cough
volumes, and free-living SPL-aware validation—enables a comprehensive
characterisation of these effects and can inform the development of
SPL-robust acoustic detection algorithms. As results come in from these
experiments, results will be posted to this document.</p>
