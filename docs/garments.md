# Effect of garment obstruction/muffling on cough detection


Garment type can systematically influence the performance of wrist-worn **acoustic** cough detection systems because clothing alters the transmission, attenuation, and contamination of body-borne acoustic energy. Clothing disrupts this pathway in several well-defined ways.


## 1. Garment-Generated Acoustic Artefacts

Sleeves in motion generate their own **contact-acoustic noise**, including frictional rubbing, fabric snapping, and rustling.

* These garment-borne vibrations can be transmitted to the device through direct contact or through transient pressure changes.
* Such artefacts can occupy the same frequency ranges as body-borne cough vibrations, increasing the risk of both false positives (artefacts mistaken for coughs) and false negatives (true coughs masked by noise).

## 2. Changes in Sensor Coupling and Fit

Although the sensing mechanism is acoustic, the **quality of mechanical–acoustic coupling** between the device and wrist strongly determines signal fidelity.

* Different garment types (tight cuffs, elastic sleeves, bulky sweaters) can slightly reposition the device or vary the contact pressure against the skin.
* Variability in coupling leads to inconsistent acoustic transmission paths and reduced reproducibility of cough signatures across conditions.

## 3. Muffling / Obstruction

Garments can form a physical barrier between which obstructs the microphone, obstructing the signal.

# Hyfe’s Experiments to Quantify Garment-Related Acoustic Interference

Hyfe is planning a structured set of **three experiments**, all focused on quantifying how clothing affects **acoustic** pathways and algorithmic performance. These experiments will take place during Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.



## **Experiment 1: Bench-Top Acoustic Transmission Study**

**Objective:**
Characterize how different fabrics and sleeve configurations modify the **acoustic transmission** of cough-like signals from a simulated wrist.

**Design Overview:**

* Use an **instrumented wrist phantom** or rigid fixture that receives standardised cough-like acoustic inputs (e.g., via a mini-shaker or speaker generating a canonical cough waveform).
* Apply controlled garment conditions:

  * Fabric type (cotton, wool, fleece, polyester, denim)
  * Sleeve tightness (tight, regular, loose)
  * Layer count (bare, single layer, multi-layer).
* Record waveform attenuation, spectral distortion, and noise generated by fabric movement.

**Rationale:**
This isolates the *acoustic* effects of clothing without human variability, establishing baseline attenuation and noise profiles for different garment types.



## **Experiment 2: Controlled Human Study With Standardised Garments**

**Objective:**
Quantitatively assess how clothing impacts **acoustic cough detection performance** in a controlled human environment.

**Design Overview:**

* Participants wear the Hyfe wrist-worn acoustic cough monitor under several garment conditions:

  * Bare wrist
  * Light long sleeve (tight and loose)
  * Sweater/hoodie
  * Jacket/outerwear
* Each participant performs:

  * Standardised voluntary coughs (for precisely labelled acoustic ground truth)
  * Controlled movements (sitting, walking, arm swings) to elicit garment-noise artefacts.
* Ground truth provided by synchronised high-quality audio or expert annotation.
* Evaluate:

  * Sensitivity/specificity under each garment condition
  * Changes in acoustic feature distributions (e.g., band-limited energy, spectral centroid, waveform envelope).

**Rationale:**
This links garment-induced acoustic interference to actual algorithmic degradation in a controlled, reproducible setting.



## **Experiment 3: Free-Living Field Study With Garment Logging**

**Objective:**
Determine the real-world impact of garment type on wrist-based acoustic cough monitoring under natural behaviour and environments.

**Design Overview:**

* Participants wear the device continuously for multiple days/weeks.
* Garment state is logged through a smartphone interface (bare wrist, light sleeve, heavy sleeve, jacket, etc.), with optional time-stamped photographs to enhance accuracy.
* A subset may wear a second, chest-mounted acoustic cough monitor or provide audio-based ground truth for periodic validation.
* Analyse:

  * Algorithmic metrics stratified by garment type
  * How daily contexts interact with clothing to affect acoustic SNR
  * Whether garment-aware models or preprocessing restore performance.

**Rationale:**
This assesses ecological validity: it quantifies how much acoustic interference clothing actually produces in everyday use and informs mitigation strategies.
