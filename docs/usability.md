# Usability Verification for the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite (CMS)  

- Feedback from 25 real-world users shows the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite (CMS) is highly usable for adults with chronic cough or related respiratory conditions.  
- 96% of participants found the watch easy to use, all were able to wear and operate it correctly, and the average usability rating was 8.6/10.  
- No serious use-related hazards or misuse patterns were identified; participants consistently used the device safely and as intended.  
- Minor issues were noted, including the watch feeling large on smaller wrists and occasional confusion about dashboard visibility or data interpretation.  
- Users appreciated minimal setup, long battery life, simple charging, and effortless day-to-day operation.  
- Several users requested clearer access to personal cough data and more intuitive dashboard explanations.  
- The study reflects authentic, unsupervised use over 2–3 weeks, supporting strong ecological validity.  
- Findings guide targeted improvements: hardware refinements, clearer onboarding, and enhanced trend-display features.  
- Although formative, results indicate system stability and user comprehension consistent with early summative expectations.  
- Next steps include integrating improvements into a new prototype and conducting further testing to confirm risk mitigation and final usability.
