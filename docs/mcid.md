# Minimal Clinically Important Difference

Work on the minimal clinically important difference in cough is ongoing. Hyfe is supporting researchers across diverse etiologies on this work. In the mean time, the best reference for chronic cough is from Schelfhout et al. The study evaluates how changes in objective 24-hour cough frequency relate to patient-reported improvement, and uses this relationship to determine a clinically meaningful within-patient change threshold (the MICD/MCT) for cough frequency. The study concludes that a ≥30% reduction in 24-hour cough frequency is a reasonable and clinically meaningful threshold (MICD/MCT) for defining treatment response.
