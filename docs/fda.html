<h1 id="validation-trial">Validation trial</h1>
<p>Hyfe carried out a dispersed, observational device accuracy study
evaluating the Hyfe Cough Diary (HCD)—a wrist-worn, non-invasive,
passive cough monitoring system designed to detect and timestamp cough
events in adults with problematic cough. The study was conducted under
real-world conditions in the United States between December 2024 and
June 2025 and followed ICH-GCP, FDA regulations, and IRB approval. The
study used the same device and algorithm used in the CMS.</p>
<h2 id="study-design">Study Design</h2>
<p>A decentralized prospective observational investigation in which each
participant wore:<br />
– the investigational Cough Watch (running Hyfe’s detection algorithm),
and<br />
– a second research smartwatch continuously recording ambient audio for
human annotation.<br />
– Participants were monitored over a continuous 24-hour period during
their normal daily living activities.<br />
– Human annotators labeled every cough in the full audio recordings
(18,305 coughs), with disagreements adjudicated by an expert reviewer to
produce a high-fidelity ground truth dataset.<br />
– Comparison was performed at daily, hourly, and event levels,
accounting for timestamp offsets and clock drift.<br />
– Inclusion required ≥20 hours of valid simultaneous recordings; 31
participants (730.84 person-hours) met criteria.</p>
<h2 id="population-characteristics">Population Characteristics</h2>
<p>– Adults ≥21 years old with problematic cough (mean age 57; 23
female).<br />
– Diverse etiologies were represented, including RCC/UCC (13), asthma
(5), bronchiectasis (4), GERD (4), NTM (2), allergies (2), acute cough
(2), laryngeal neuropathy (2), UACS (2), and others.<br />
– Participants were recruited from typical living environments, with
exclusion only for unusually loud settings or major antitussive therapy
changes.</p>
<h2 id="primary-and-secondary-objectives">Primary and Secondary
Objectives</h2>
<p>– Primary Objective: Assess hour-by-hour agreement between HCD and
human annotators using Bland–Altman methods.<br />
– Secondary Objectives:<br />
– Event-level accuracy (sensitivity, false positives, PPV)<br />
– Daily and hourly concordance via linear and Deming regression<br />
– Subgroup, diurnal, and rate-stratified performance analyses.</p>
<h2 id="key-clinical-results">Key Clinical Results</h2>
<p>– Daily and hourly concordance: Lin’s Concordance Correlation
Coefficient &gt;0.95 for both coughs and cough-seconds.<br />
– Event-level detection:<br />
- Median sensitivity 87.3% (coughs) and 90.5% (cough-seconds).<br />
– False positives: Median ~1.7 per hour.<br />
– Categorization accuracy:<br />
– 84% correct category classification of patients (none off by &gt;1
ordinal level).<br />
– 78% correct hour-level classification; 95% correct or off by one
level.<br />
– Zero instances of long sequences of major misclassification.<br />
– No adverse events, no device-related harms, and no device
failures.</p>
