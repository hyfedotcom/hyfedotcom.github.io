<h1 id="wear-vs-non-wear-detection-using-hyfes-ppg-based-algorithm">Wear
vs non-wear detection using Hyfe’s PPG-based algorithm</h1>
<p>Hyfe has created and validated a lightweight photoplethysmography
(PPG)-based algorithm that reliably determines whether the CoughWatch
smartwatch is being worn. Importantly, this method does not depend on
accelerometer signals. Conventional accelerometer-driven wear-detection
approaches often misclassify periods of inactivity (e.g., when a user is
resting) as non-wear and typically require long observation windows to
achieve acceptable accuracy.</p>
<p>Hyfe’s approach periodically activates the PPG sensor for 20 seconds
every 5 minutes, processes the resulting optical-reflection data with a
simple decision-tree classifier, and delivers real-time wear status.
Trained on approximately 100 person-hours and validated against over
2,700 hours of human-annotated data, the algorithm demonstrated 98.93%
overall accuracy, with 0.55% false negatives and 2.06% false positives.
Battery consumption remained low, averaging 24.2% over 24 hours, which
matches typical device usage.</p>
<p>This advancement provides a high-frequency, low-burden, and highly
precise method for monitoring device adherence, thereby improving the
reliability of continuous physiological and behavioral data—an essential
requirement for clinical trials and long-term observational studies.</p>
<p>The Hyfe wear vs non-wear PPG-based algorithm has been validated. <a
