id="verification-of-battery-durability-microphone-reliability-and-device-performance-integrity">Verification
of Battery Durability, Microphone Reliability, and Device Performance
Integrity</h1>
<p>To ensure consistent and reliable operation of Hyfe’s CoughMonitor
Suite (CMS) in clinical and real-world research environments, Hyfe
implements multiple layers of verification testing focused on device
durability, sensor reliability, and ongoing performance integrity. These
procedures encompass in-study battery durability assessments, microphone
robustness testing under water-exposure stress, and continuous
monitoring for anomalous system behavior that may indicate device
malfunction. In addition, Hyfe ensures that all research deployments use
new devices to mitigate the risks associated with hardware degradation
over time.</p>
<h2 id="in-study-verification-of-battery-durability">In-Study
Verification of Battery Durability</h2>
<p>Battery reliability is a critical determinant of longitudinal data
completeness in real-world evidence (RWE) studies. To verify that
devices maintain expected operational performance throughout the
duration of a study, Hyfe conducts ongoing in-study battery durability
assessments. These analyses employ passive logging of battery charge
level as a function of time across all active devices in the field.</p>
<p>These in-study evaluations enable early detection of atypical
discharge behavior, which can indicate hardware defects, battery aging,
or charging-related anomalies. When deviations are identified, Hyfe
initiates targeted device replacement or participant follow-up to
prevent data loss and maintain protocol compliance. Overall, this
real-world monitoring framework confirms that the devices sustain stable
battery performance under authentic usage conditions.</p>
<p>In these studies, it has been determined that the device drains at
approximately a rate of 28% per 24 hours.</p>
<p><img src="../img/durability4.png" /></p>
<p>Old (&gt;40 prior cycles) and new (&lt;40 cycles) have been compared.
The effect of 40 prior cycles on battery durability is negligible (see
below chart).</p>
<p><img src="../img/durability5.png" /></p>
<p>The same comparison was made between older (&gt;80 cycles) and
younger (&lt;80 cycles) devices. Though the rate at which batteries
drained was greater than at the &gt;40 threshold, the effect is still
minor, with the resultant cumulative time-to-empty still greater than
the 3 days barrier.</p>
<p><img src="../img/durability6.png" /></p>
<p>Used the empirical battery values observed in these RWE trials, a
matrix of predictions was generated estimating battery drain as a
function of hours elapsed since full charge (x-axis) and prior charges
(y-axis). In all cases, up to 100 charges, the battery is expected to
surpass the 3 days barrier (see below chart).</p>

<h2
id="verification-of-microphone-reliability-after-water-exposure">Verification
of Microphone Reliability After Water Exposure</h2>
<p>A subset of device reliability testing conducted by Hyfe focuses on
ensuring that acoustic sensing performance is preserved following brief
exposure to water, a realistic scenario for wearable devices and
handheld sensors (for example, during dishwashing or bathing). To
investigate microphone robustness to water exposure, Hyfe performed
intentional submersion testing, in which devices were exposed to
controlled water immersion consistent with common scenarios, 10 times
(see below image).</p>
<p><img src="../img/durability1.png" /></p>
<p>Cough detection capability was assessed via the playback of 100
coughs via controlled speaker. Following this exposure, all devices’
sensitivity remained within the range of expectations (ie, 85-90%) (see
below image).</p>
<p><img src="../img/durability2.png" /></p>
<p>These tests demonstrated that the microphones retained functional
acoustic integrity even after repeated water-exposure cycles, with no
systematic deterioration in cough-detection performance. This provides
strong evidence that the sensing pipeline is robust to realistic
environmental challenges, such as showering or bathing.</p>
<p>A subsequent test saw devices submerged for 20 consecutive hours. The
same assessment was carried out following submersion. In this case,
significant performance deterioration occurred in 3 of 4 devices (see
below image).</p>
<p><img src="../img/durability3.png" /></p>
<p>Accordingly, study participants are told that occasional short-term
water exposure is acceptable, but that prolonged submersion should be
avoided.</p>
<h2
id="continuous-monitoring-for-anomalous-cough-frequency-patterns">Continuous
Monitoring for Anomalous Cough-Frequency Patterns</h2>
<p>In addition to physical durability testing, Hyfe employs continuous,
real-time surveillance to ensure reliable device function during data
collection. The system monitors for unexpected or physiologically
implausible cough-frequency patterns, which may signal device
malfunction rather than genuine participant symptoms.</p>
<p>Examples of anomalies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero cough activity across prolonged periods in participants with
established baseline cough rates</li>
<li>Sudden, extreme decreases in detected events suggestive of
microphone obstruction, moisture interference, or sensor
displacement</li>
<li>Abrupt spikes in detected coughs inconsistent with expected
physiological ranges</li>
</ul>
<p>When such patterns are detected, automated alarms and alerts are
generated, prompting investigation by Hyfe’s technical team and/or study
staff. This monitoring framework has successfully identified episodes of
microphone obstruction (e.g., covered devices, damaged housings) and
ensures that data anomalies are addressed rapidly to preserve the
integrity of study outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-new-devices-to-prevent-performance-degradation">Use of
New Devices to Prevent Performance Degradation</h2>
<p>To ensure that device performance remains consistent and free from
confounding effects related to prior wear, Hyfe deploys new devices for
each study. This practice minimizes risks associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery aging or cycle fatigue</li>
<li>Microphone degradation due to environmental exposure or mechanical
wear</li>
<li>Sensor drift, housing damage, or loss of water-resistance
integrity</li>
<li>Any cumulative deterioration that could affect acoustic fidelity or
device responsiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>By standardizing on unused hardware at study initiation, Hyfe ensures
that all devices meet manufacturer specifications and internal
performance benchmarks, thereby strengthening the validity and
reproducibility of study outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, Hyfe employs a comprehensive and proactive approach to
hardware reliability verification, integrating in-study battery
assessments, water-exposure stress testing, continuous monitoring for
anomalous acoustic behavior, and the use of new devices for each
research deployment. These procedures collectively safeguard data
quality and ensure robust performance of the system across diverse
research settings.</p>
