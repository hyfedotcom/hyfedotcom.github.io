<p>Microphone gain—the amplification applied to an acoustic input signal
prior to digitization—is a potential source of variability in
audio-based sensing systems. In the context of cough monitoring
technologies, differences in microphone gain could theoretically
influence the apparent intensity, spectral characteristics, and
detectability of cough events. Because Hyfe’s cough monitoring
algorithms depend on consistent acoustic capture across diverse devices,
it was important to determine whether device-to-device variability in
microphone gain could materially influence detection sensitivity (or
false positivity rates) or require per-device calibration
procedures.</p>
<p>To evaluate this, Hyfe conducted controlled laboratory assessments
designed to isolate the effect of microphone gain on cough detection
performance. The testing involved exposing multiple representative
devices to standardized acoustic stimuli, including recorded human
coughs, played at reproducible levels in an acoustically controlled
environment. This approach allowed gain-dependent variation in the
recorded signals to be measured independently of extraneous
environmental or behavioral factors.</p>
<p>The data demonstrated that varying microphone gain did indeed affect
sensitivity. The below chart shows sensitivity to cough on three
perceived “volumes” of coughs, at varying gain levels.</p>
<p><img src="../img/gain1.png" /></p>
<p>Gain was also found to have a significant effect on the rate of false
positives (below chart).</p>
<p><img src="../img/gain2.png" /></p>
<p>Given that different gain levels produced different cough detection
accuracy, the analysis team used a decibelometer and standardized
synthetic frequencies to identify de facto differences in gain across
devices, in an effort to homogenize gain through posterior adjustment.
The below shows an example of this calibration.</p>
<p><img src="../img/gain3.png" /></p>
<p>The variance in gain levels which were found to have a meaningful
effect on cough detection rates fell far outside the de facto variance
in gain across devices. In other words, diversity in observed gain per
devices was found to be within the operational ranges typical for
consumer-grade device hardware (below chart shows empirical amplitude
values over pre-defined homogenized audio from different mics in the
test batch, with near uniform average amplitude and only minor, in-spec
diversity in range).</p>
<p><img src="../img/gain4.png" /></p>
<p>Given the lack of heterogeneity in de facto gain per device, these
minor differenes were determined to produce only minor variation in the
amplitude and spectral representation of cough-like acoustic events.
When these recordings were processed using Hyfe’s detection algorithms,
the resulting changes in sensitivity and signal classification
confidence were negligible. Importantly, although small amplitude shifts
were observed—as expected when modifying pre-amplification
parameters—these variations did not meaningfully affect the algorithm’s
ability to identify cough events. This suggests that the modeling
approach is robust to modest front-end signal level differences.</p>
<p>Further analysis compared microphones across multiple devices from
different production batches. In line with normal manufacturing
tolerances, measured gain differences between units were minimal. The
microphones exhibited consistent frequency response and overall acoustic
sensitivity, and any intrinsic variability fell well within the
tolerance range demonstrated to be inconsequential during the controlled
gain-alteration experiments. Thus, device-to-device heterogeneity in
microphone gain exists, but was not found to be a relevant factor
affecting overall system performance.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, Hyfe concluded that device-specific
calibration or gain adjustment procedures are not required for reliable
cough detection. The combination of stable microphone behavior across
devices and the algorithm’s tolerance to minor input-level variation
ensures that sensitivity remains consistent without additional
calibration steps. This simplifies deployment, supports scalability
across device models, and reinforces the robustness of the acoustic
sensing pipeline under real-world conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, the microphone gain verification study provides strong
evidence that microphone gain is not a limiting factor in system
performance, and that Hyfe’s cough detection technology functions
reliably across devices without the need for individualized adjustment
or calibration.</p>
