## Informed Consent Template

The ICF provides participants with essential information about the study, including its purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, privacy protections, and voluntary nature. It explains that the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite detects coughs using short sound signatures without storing audio, ensuring privacy. The document outlines participant rights, data confidentiality, data storage practices, and conditions for withdrawal. A second section contains the formal consent certificate, with signature fields, witness options for illiterate participants, and a researcher attestation confirming proper explanation and voluntary participation.
