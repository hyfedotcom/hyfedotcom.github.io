<p>Objective cough frequency correlates with clinically meaningful
outcomes and measures.</p>
<p>In “Digital cough monitoring – A potential predictive acoustic
biomarker of clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients”,
Altshuler et al demonstrate that cough counts are predictors for
clinical outcomes in a large cohort of prospectively-monitored Covid-19
patients. Link to full article:
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9827741/</p>
<p>Many other independent research studies have demonstrated cough
counts correlating with clinical outcomes or established clinical
measures, such as disease severity, treatment response, or
patient-reported symptom scores. A sample of these is below:</p>
<pre><code>1. Decalmer, S. C., Webster, D., Kelsall, A. A., McGuinness, K., Woodcock, A. A., &amp; Smith, J. A. (2007). Chronic cough: how do cough reflex sensitivity and subjective assessments correlate with objective cough counts during ambulatory monitoring? Thorax, 62(4), 329–334.   </code></pre>
<p>Link: https://doi.org/10.1136/thx.2006.067413</p>
<p>Summary: In this study of patients with chronic cough, objectively
recorded cough frequency was compared to various clinical measures. The
strongest association was an inverse correlation between 24-hour cough
count and cough-related quality of life (Leicester Cough Questionnaire
scores), with higher cough frequencies corresponding to worse quality of
life (r = –0.62, p ≤ 0.001)[1][2]. By contrast, patients’ self-rated
cough severity and cough reflex sensitivity (capsaicin test) showed only
moderate correlations with the actual cough counts[3][4]. This suggests
that objective cough counts closely reflect the impact of cough on
patients’ daily functioning, whereas subjective estimates alone are less
reliable.</p>

<p>Summary: This clinical trial analysis examined how changes in
objective cough counts relate to patient-reported outcomes in chronic
cough. It found that 24-hour cough frequencies had significant but
modest correlations with cough severity ratings, diary scores, and
quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and during treatment
(Spearman ρ ~0.30–0.58)[5]. Importantly, patients who reported
substantial improvement on a global scale had large reductions in cough
count: those “much/very much improved” showed about a 55% drop in cough
frequency, while “minimally improved” patients had ~30% drops[5][6].
Receiver-operator analysis determined that roughly a 38% decrease in
cough frequency optimally predicted a meaningful improvement, and the
authors proposed a ≥30% cough count reduction as a reasonable threshold
for clinically significant treatment response[7][6]. Thus, objective
cough monitoring was validated as an outcome measure that tracks with
symptom improvement in chronic cough trials.</p>

<p>Summary: This study focused on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
and measured patients’ cough counts over 24 hours alongside clinical
assessments. IPF patients had high cough rates, and these objective
counts showed strong correlations with patient-reported cough measures:
daytime cough frequency correlated with visual analog scale (VAS)
ratings of cough severity (r ≈ 0.80, p &lt; 0.001) and with
cough-specific quality of life (LCQ, r = –0.80, p &lt; 0.001)[8].
Notably, objective cough frequency did not correlate with lung function
indices (such as spirometry results) in these patients[8]. This
indicates that while cough count is closely tied to how severe and
bothersome patients perceive their cough to be, it operates
independently of traditional physiological markers. In IPF, cough
frequency thus reflects symptomatic burden and quality-of-life impact
rather than disease extent on pulmonary function tests[9][10].</p>

<p>Link: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00408-017-0038-x</p>
<p>Summary: In patients with bronchiectasis, 24-hour cough monitoring
was used to quantify cough and relate it to clinical outcomes. Cough
counts were markedly higher in bronchiectasis patients than in healthy
controls, and higher cough frequency was associated with significantly
worse health status. In particular, objective cough counts correlated
inversely with scores on the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and the
Bronchiectasis Health Questionnaire (greater cough frequency = lower
quality of life; LCQ r = –0.52, BHQ r = –0.62, both p &lt; 0.001)[11].
Patients who coughed more also tended to have more sputum production and
more frequent exacerbations requiring antibiotics, factors which
together with age explained over half the variance in cough
frequency[12]. There was no significant link between cough count and
lung function measurements in these patients[12]. These results suggest
that in bronchiectasis, objective cough frequency tracks with symptom
burden and disease impact (like infections and daily respiratory
symptoms) better than traditional lung function indices, supporting
cough counts as a useful outcome measure of disease severity in this
context.</p>

<p>Summary: This prospective cohort study in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)
patients demonstrated that objective cough monitoring correlates with
both disease severity and treatment response. At diagnosis, patients
with higher Mycobacterium tuberculosis loads (as indicated by
quantitative cultures) had significantly more frequent coughing on
average[13]. As TB treatment commenced, cough frequency dropped rapidly:
the median cough rate fell by about 80% after 2 weeks of therapy (from
~2.3 episodes/hour pre-treatment to ~0.5/hour at day 14)[13]. This early
reduction in coughing paralleled microbiological improvement –
approximately one-third of patients had converted to negative cultures
by the 14-day point[14][15]. By the end of the two-month observation,
cough counts had decreased further in those responding to treatment[13].
The findings illustrate that an objective cough count is closely aligned
with TB disease activity: a high cough count signals greater infectious
burden, and a declining cough count reflects effective treatment and
reduced infectiousness[15]. This supports using cough frequency as a
quantitative indicator of patient prognosis and response in TB
management.</p>
