Verification for the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite (CMS)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Feedback from 25 real-world users shows the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite
(CMS) is highly usable for adults with chronic cough or related
respiratory conditions.<br />
</li>
<li>96% of participants found the watch easy to use, all were able to
wear and operate it correctly, and the average usability rating was
8.6/10.<br />
</li>
<li>No serious use-related hazards or misuse patterns were identified;
participants consistently used the device safely and as intended.<br />
</li>
<li>Minor issues were noted, including the watch feeling large on
smaller wrists and occasional confusion about dashboard visibility or
data interpretation.<br />
</li>
<li>Users appreciated minimal setup, long battery life, simple charging,
and effortless day-to-day operation.<br />
</li>
<li>Several users requested clearer access to personal cough data and
more intuitive dashboard explanations.<br />
</li>
<li>The study reflects authentic, unsupervised use over 2–3 weeks,
supporting strong ecological validity.<br />
</li>
<li>Findings guide targeted improvements: hardware refinements, clearer
onboarding, and enhanced trend-display features.<br />
</li>
<li>Although formative, results indicate system stability and user
comprehension consistent with early summative expectations.<br />
</li>
<li>Next steps include integrating improvements into a new prototype and
conducting further testing to confirm risk mitigation and final
usability.<br />
