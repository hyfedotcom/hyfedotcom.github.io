<p>Monitoring duration is important to the correct and accurate
measurement of the phenomonon of cough, especially given its highly
variable nature. Accordingly, Hyfe has carried out research looking into
the optimal monitoring period to capture one’s true, underlying cough
rate.</p>
<p>This document presents a 30-day observational study evaluating
continuous, passive cough monitoring in individuals with persistent
cough using Hyfe’s smartphone-based and wearable cough-detection
technology. The objective was to characterize day-to-day variability in
cough frequency, assess the limitations of traditional 24-hour
monitoring windows, and evaluate the predictability of cough patterns
over extended periods.</p>
<p>The study followed 57 users for 30 days and collected more than 20
daily monitoring hours per participant using two Hyfe applications
(CoughPro and CoughTracker). Coughs were identified using automated
acoustic detection and classification, with all audio processed in a
privacy-preserving manner. Outcome measures included daily cough
frequencies, daily cough variability within and between subjects, and
predictive modeling of future cough load based on previous days’
data.</p>
<p>The results show extremely wide variability in cough frequency across
individuals—ranging from approximately 6.5 to 182 coughs per hour.
Within-subject cough frequency also fluctuated significantly from one
day to the next. Despite this variability, predictability analysis
showed that for participants with higher cough burdens (&gt;6 coughs per
hour), multi-day monitoring enabled reasonably accurate prediction of
future cough frequency, particularly when looking at 7-day windows. The
heat-map visualization (Figure 3) illustrates how predictability varies
at the individual level across the 30-day period.</p>
<p>The study concludes that cough frequency is highly variable both
between and within individuals, making single-day measurements
insufficient for understanding meaningful trends. For people with
persistent cough, at least 7 days of monitoring are needed to achieve
reliable estimation of typical cough frequency and to detect clinically
meaningful change. This reinforces the importance of longitudinal,
passive, continuous cough monitoring for respiratory research and future
clinical applications.</p>
