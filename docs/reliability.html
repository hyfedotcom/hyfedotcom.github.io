<h2 id="test-re-test-reliability">Test / re-test reliability</h2>
<p>Test–retest reliability is critical for a cough detector’s clinical
utility because it establishes whether the device produces stable,
repeatable cough counts when the underlying clinical reality has not
changed. If a cough detector cannot reliably generate similar results
under the same conditions, its data cannot be trusted for clinical or
research use.</p>
<h3 id="ensures-stability-of-measurement">Ensures Stability of
Measurement</h3>
<p>Test–retest reliability answers the question: Does the device give
similar cough counts today and tomorrow when the person’s cough has not
truly changed?</p>
<p>If the counts fluctuate widely in stable conditions, the device is
measuring noise, not cough. High test–retest reliability shows that the
device’s outputs reflect the patient’s physiology, not random
algorithmic or sensor variability.</p>
<h3
id="differentiates-true-clinical-change-from-device-error">Differentiates
True Clinical Change From Device Error</h3>
<p>Clinicians and researchers must detect real improvement or worsening.
Reliable devices allow users to interpret:</p>
<p>A reduction in cough as a real response to treatment, not a random
drop from device inconsistency.</p>
<p>A spike in cough as a true exacerbation, not an artifact.</p>
<p>Without test–retest reliability, it’s impossible to know whether
observed differences are biologically meaningful.</p>
<h3 id="improves-research-validity-and-statistical-power">Improves
Research Validity and Statistical Power</h3>
<p>Inconsistent measurements increase noise in datasets, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces statistical power<br />
</li>
<li>Inflates sample size requirements<br />
</li>
<li>Obscures treatment effects</li>
</ul>
<p>High test–retest reliability means:<br />
- Lower variance<br />
- Smaller confidence intervals<br />
- Smaller sample size<br />
- Cleaner detection of clinically important differences</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Test–retest reliability is essential because a cough detector must
produce stable cough counts when the patient hasn’t changed—otherwise it
cannot support clinical interpretation, evaluate treatments, or reliably
monitor disease over time.</p>
<p>The below image shows test / re-test consistency (y-axis, correlation
in cough rates between the two periods, as measured by the Pearson’s
Correlation Coefficient) as a function of number of days of the test /
re-test period (x-axis). This analysis was carried out in a population
with no intervention (ie, expected clinical state = static).</p>
