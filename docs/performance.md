# Performance

## Success criteria

Hyfe's performance has been assessed against a set of criteria established through an iterative survey/interview process with key opinion leaders and other stakeholders in the cough space in a study whose details are available [here](fda.html). 

Full details on how success criteria were established are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLXJYoNS9LIqGoOeYPJ3FLJKO_m7l-XD3T82BRic9w8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Results

All success criteria were satisfied.  


- **The Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient has a value of >0.9 for daily cough counts and cough-second counts.**  
	- Coughs: 0.971  
	- Cough-seconds: 0.956    
	

- **The Lin’s Concordance Correlation Coefficient has a value of >0.9 for hourly cough and cough-second counts.**  
	- Coughs: 0.9748
	- Cough-seconds: 0.9683  
- **Event-specific sensitivity has a median value of >85% (coughs and cough-seconds) ** 
	- Coughs: 87.34%  
	- Cough-seconds: 90.48%  
- **Event-specific false positives per hour has a median value of <2.5 (coughs and cough-seconds) **   
	- Coughs: 1.67  
	- Cough-seconds: 1.56  
- **At least 75% of patients are correctly classified as low (0-10 per hour), medium-low (10-20 per hour), medium-high (20-30 per hour), or high (30+ per hour) rate coughers per their 24 hour counts.**  
	- Correctly classified, coughs: (83.87 %)  
	- Correctly classified, coughs-seconds: (80.65 %)   
- Using the same categories, >85% of patients are correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level per their 24 hour counts.    
	- Correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level, individuals, coughs: 31 (100 %)  
	- Correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level, individuals, coughs-seconds: 31 (100 %)  
- **Using the same categories, >85% of person-hours are correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level.  **
	- Correctly classified hours, coughs: 686 (86.29 %)  
	- Correctly classified hours, cough-seconds: 686 (86.29 %)  
	- Correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level, hours, coughs: 784 (98.62 %)  
	-  Correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level, hours, cough-seconds: 787 (98.99 %)  
- **Patient-specific trends are correctly captured using the following method: (a) each patient’s hourly cough counts are binned by quartile using ground truth data (low being the 0-25th percentile coughs; medium-low being the 25-50th percentile coughs, etc.); for >75% of patients, >75% of their hours are correctly categorized into quartile bins by HCD, or misclassified by only one ordinal level.   ** 
	- Correctly classified hours, coughs: 621 (78.11%)  
	- Correctly classified hours, cough-seconds: 628 (79.0%)  
	- Correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level, hours, coughs: 761 (95.72%)  
	- Correctly classified or misclassified by only one ordinal level, hours, cough-seconds: 758 (95.35%)
