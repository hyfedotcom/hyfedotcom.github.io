<h1 id="objective-cough-counting-vs-patient-recall">Objective
cough-counting vs patient recall</h1>
<p>Cough is a highly variable and unpredictable behavior, making it
extremely difficult for clinicians to estimate cough frequency through
direct observation. Even at the highest cough rate documented in Hyfe’s
validation study (111 coughs/hour), a clinician would need to observe a
patient for many hours to achieve even a minimally reliable estimate—an
unrealistic approach in real-world medical practice.</p>
<p>Because direct observation is impractical, the current clinical “gold
standard” for cough frequency is patient recall. However, extensive
evidence—including prior research (e.g., Decalmer 2007)—shows that
recall is highly unreliable, particularly over long periods. Hyfe’s
validation study further confirms this: when nine departing participants
were asked to estimate how many times they coughed during the study, two
could not provide a number at all and seven gave widely inaccurate
estimates. Except for one low-cough participant, system estimates
aligned far more closely with ground truth than patient recall did (as
illustrated in the below figure).</p>

<p>Taken together, these results show that system accuracy must be
judged relative to the available alternative—not in isolation. Since
patient recall is significantly less accurate and far less granular,
relying on it carries greater risk, including potential mismanagement of
medications tied to cough severity. While clinicians may be accustomed
to the limitations of recall, the system provides transparent accuracy
labeling and more reliable objective data, offering a safer and more
informative basis for clinical decision-making.</p>
