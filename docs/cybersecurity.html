Verification for the Hyfe CoughMonitoring Suite (CMS)</h1>
<p>This document provides a consolidated summary of the cybersecurity
assessments performed on the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite (CMS), including
the Android application, the iOS application, and the Insights API. The
results across all three components indicate that the CMS platform is
cybersecure, implements modern protections, and contains no critical
vulnerabilities. The content below integrates the findings from the
Android static analysis, the iOS static analysis, and the API
penetration test. Citations reference the reviewed files.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-verification">1. Scope of Verification</h2>
<p>The cybersecurity evaluations covered the core components of the CMS
ecosystem:<br />
- the Android application - the iOS application<br />
- and the Insights API backend services</p>
<p>Testing included static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration
testing aligned with OWASP guidance. Each component was examined for
encryption use, certificate configuration, data handling patterns,
storage behaviors, network activity, authentication flows, and
permission practices. All analyses were conducted on production or
production-equivalent builds to ensure realistic characterization of
risk.</p>
<h2 id="overall-cybersecurity-conclusion">2. Overall Cybersecurity
Conclusion</h2>
<p>Across all testing activities, no critical or high-severity
vulnerabilities were identified in any part of the CMS platform. All
findings were low-severity or informational in nature and did not expose
user data, compromise backend integrity, or threaten overall system
security. The platform consistently uses encrypted communication,
applies secure authentication mechanisms, and avoids dangerous
data-handling behaviors. Based on the combined evidence from all three
assessments, the CMS platform is considered secure for real-world use,
including deployment in regulated health environments where
cybersecurity protections are essential.</p>
<h2 id="insights-api-security-verification">3. Insights API Security
Verification</h2>
<p>An OWASP-based penetration test was performed against the production
Hyfe Insights API. The API demonstrated strong security fundamentals,
including the use of modern encryption protocols such as TLS 1.2 and TLS
1.3. Certificates were valid, properly configured, and not revoked.
Access to all endpoints behaved as intended, and authentication and
authorization controls operated correctly. The assessment identified
only one medium-severity item: a permissive CORS configuration that
allowed broader-than-necessary cross-origin requests. Several
low-severity items were also noted, including the absence of an HSTS
header and the absence of an X-Content-Type-Options header. None of
these issues exposed sensitive data, enabled unauthorized access, or
represented a meaningful security risk.</p>
<h2 id="android-application-security-verification">4. Android
Application Security Verification</h2>
<p>The Android application review found no insecure permissions, no
dangerous API calls, and no inappropriate network behaviors. The
application did not contain malware, unsafe libraries, trackers, or
data-exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets or insecure storage
patterns were discovered. All network interactions were properly routed
through secure, encrypted API channels. The static analysis demonstrated
that the Android app follows modern security practices and does not
handle data in a manner that would compromise user privacy or system
integrity.</p>
<h2 id="ios-application-security-verification">5. iOS Application
Security Verification</h2>
<p>The iOS application achieved a security score of 85 out of 100 and
contained zero trackers. This is considered “very secure” per general
industry standards of:</p>
<ul>
<li>90–100 → Highly secure<br />
</li>
<li>80–89 → Very secure<br />
</li>
<li>65–79 → Secure / Acceptably secure with moderate issues<br />
</li>
<li>&lt;65 → Potentially insecure / significant issues</li>
</ul>
<p>The score means o critical vulnerabilities, no high-risk issues, only
minor or low-risk findings, reliable configuration and a strong privacy
posture.</p>
<p>The assessment found no dangerous permissions, no violations of
Apple’s App Transport Security requirements, and no high-severity risks.
Two informational findings were noted: the use of a database library in
a manner that should ensure sensitive information is encrypted, and
logging patterns that should avoid capturing sensitive data. These
issues did not involve actual data exposure or insecure storage in the
tested configuration. The iOS application contained no malware, unsafe
code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or insecure networking activity. All
communications traveled through encrypted channels to the secure
backend.</p>
<h2 id="integrated-security-assessment">6. Integrated Security
Assessment</h2>
<p>Taken together, the results from the API, Android application, and
iOS application assessments show consistent security practices across
the CMS platform. All components rely on encrypted communication,
maintain secure storage behaviors, and avoid patterns that would put
confidential data at risk. The limited findings identified across the
assessments were configuration-related and minor, rather than functional
vulnerabilities or exploitable weaknesses. No component demonstrated
behavior that would threaten confidentiality, integrity, or
availability. The overall security posture of the CMS platform is strong
and well-aligned with modern healthcare cybersecurity expectations.</p>
<h2 id="final-determination">7. Final Determination</h2>
<p>Based on independent testing of the Insights API, Android
application, and iOS application, the CMS meets contemporary
cybersecurity requirements and demonstrates no critical risks. The
system is considered cybersecure and appropriate for deployment in
environments that require reliable protection of health-related
data.</p>
