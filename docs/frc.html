curve equivalence verification</h1>
<p>The frequency-response profile of a microphone—the relationship
between input acoustic frequency and captured output amplitude—is a
critical determinant of performance in audio-based sensing systems. For
cough monitoring, accurate representation of the broadband impulsive
spectra characteristic of cough events is essential to ensure consistent
algorithmic detection across deployed devices. Although component
manufacturers perform standardized acoustic testing during production,
Hyfe undertook an independent verification process to evaluate whether
frequency-response variability across device units could introduce
systematic differences in cough detection sensitivity or necessitate
device-specific post-production calibration.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-manufacturer-testing">Overview of Manufacturer
Testing</h2>
<p>All microphones integrated into the target devices are accompanied by
manufacturer-certified acoustic characterization. This testing,
performed under controlled laboratory conditions, includes
frequency-response measurements designed to confirm that each microphone
meets the established technical specifications defined for that model
and production batch. These specifications typically include tolerance
bands across the audible spectrum, ensuring adequate linearity, and
predictable behavior at common speech-associated frequencies. The
manufacturer’s qualification data therefore provide a foundational
assurance that gross deviations or defective components are not present.
The below image shows the manufacturer-provided frequency response
curve.</p>
<p><img src="../img/frc2.png" /></p>
<p>Hyfe’s testing was not intended to duplicate or replace manufacturer
certification. Instead, it served as an independent verification
exercise to determine whether <strong>normal, specification-compliant
variability</strong> in frequency response could impact the downstream
performance of Hyfe’s cough detection algorithms. The goal was to assess
whether additional homogenization, calibration factors, or algorithmic
gain compensation would be required following device assembly.</p>
<h2 id="test-methodology">Test Methodology</h2>
<p>Hyfe performed controlled acoustic measurements using a
<strong>synthetic sweeping sinusoidal stimulus</strong> (commonly termed
a “frequency sweep” or “chirp”) covering the operational bandwidth
relevant to cough acoustics and general human soundscape when sampled at
8khz (100 to 4,000 hz), at increasing volume. See below for sweep
characteristics.</p>
<p><img src="../img/frc3.png" /></p>
<p>The sweep was generated via a calibrated loudspeaker within an
acoustically controlled space to minimize reflections and environmental
distortion (see below image of testing rigt).</p>
<p><img src="../img/frc1.png" /></p>
<p>The stimulus was engineered to exhibit a flat amplitude profile,
allowing deviations in recorded amplitude to be attributed directly to
device microphone characteristics rather than input signal
irregularities.</p>
<p>Multiple devices from different manufacturing batches were placed at
fixed distances and orientations relative to the sound source to ensure
spatial consistency. The devices recorded the sweeping signal
simultaneously to enable direct comparison across units. Raw waveform
data were captured at native sampling rates and processed using
standardized digital signal analysis procedures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based reconstruction of
frequency-response curves</li>
<li>Normalization of input amplitude across frequencies</li>
<li>Statistical quantification of inter-device variability (e.g., mean
absolute deviation, band-limited variance measures, spectral coherence
analysis)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results-and-interpretation">Results and Interpretation</h2>
<p>Across all tested units, the resulting frequency-response curves
demonstrated high concordance. Observed variation had no significant
deviations in either amplitude or spectral shape that would meaningfully
affect the capture of cough-relevant acoustic features. See below for a
visual example of equivalence.</p>
<p><img src="../img/frc4.png" /></p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differences across devices were small in magnitude and exhibited no
systematic frequency-dependent bias.</li>
<li>Variability tended to be random rather than directional, consistent
with expected manufacturing tolerances.</li>
<li>Spectral coherence analysis showed strong overlap across devices,
indicating that all units reproduced the sweeping stimulus in a
fundamentally similar manner.</li>
<li>The minor deviations observed did not meaningfully alter algorithmic
extraction of cough signatures, as Hyfe’s detection models rely on
spectral patterns that are invariant to modest front-end hardware
variation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was determined that no device-specific shifts were observed that
would necessitate calibration or correction. Detection sensitivity and
confidence remained stable across the test set.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The verification study confirmed that the microphones’
frequency-response characteristics are sufficiently uniform across
devices to support reliable, calibration-free deployment of Hyfe’s cough
detection system. Manufacturer certification ensures baseline compliance
with acoustic specifications, and Hyfe’s independent validation
demonstrated that the residual variability among units—even across
different batches—does not materially affect algorithmic performance. As
a result, <strong>post-production acoustic calibration or homogenization
procedures were deemed unnecessary</strong>.</p>
<p>This outcome simplifies field deployment, reduces manufacturing
complexity, and provides strong evidence that Hyfe’s sensing pipeline is
robust to realistic hardware variability, aligning the system with the
reliability and reproducibility expectations required for healthcare and
pharmaceutical applications.</p>
