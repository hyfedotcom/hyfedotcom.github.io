<h1 id="standard-operating-procedure-for-labeling">Standard Operating
Procedure for Labeling</h1>
<p>The below is Hyfe’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for
understanding, identifying, and labeling cough and cough-like acoustic
events within continuous audio recordings. It forms part of Hyfe’s
formal Validation Documentation (2023) and establishes the
methodological foundation for producing high-quality, standardized
ground-truth datasets used in algorithm development and performance
verification.</p>
<p>This SOP is a comprehensive labeling manual that provides:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A Scientific Framework for Cough Physiology and Acoustics: The
document begins with detailed explanations of cough anatomy and
physiology—covering the pharynx, larynx, epiglottis, and vocal cords—and
describes the acoustic waveforms associated with expulsive and vocal
phases of coughs (pages 1–8). These diagrams and examples ensure that
labelers understand not only what a cough sounds like, but why it sounds
as it does biologically.</li>
<li>A Rigorous Multi-Tier Labeling System: The SOP defines explicit
labeling categories (COUGH, THROAT_CLEAR, SNEEZE, CRY) and a structured
tag system (Far, Not Sure) to capture acoustic ambiguity or distance
effects (pages 9–11). These categories and tags are consistently
illustrated using examples and spectrograms.</li>
<li>A Detailed Procedure for Consistent Annotation Using the Hyfe
Continuous Labeling Web App: The document includes step-by-step
instructions for opening, navigating, and labeling audio within Hyfe’s
dedicated web application (pages 21–27). It prescribes zoom levels,
selection methods, waveform inspection strategies, and use of
spectrograms to ensure precise marking of beginnings and endings of
events.</li>
<li>Extensive Examples and Edge-Case Demonstrations: Many pages contain
annotated cough, throat-clear, and sneeze examples (pages 11–20),
reflecting real-world acoustic complexity. These examples serve as
training material and calibration references for human annotators.</li>
<li>A Formal Assessment and Competency Check for Labelers: The SOP
includes a self-assessment questionnaire (pages 28–29) and defines a
pass threshold (95%) for final evaluation before labelers are certified
to contribute to gold-standard datasets.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-this-document-is-critical-for-validation">Why This Document
Is Critical for Validation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>It Ensures Ground Truth Is Consistent, Reproducible, and
Scientifically Defensible: All accuracy assessments of Hyfe’s cough
detection algorithms depend on a high-quality ground truth—i.e., precise
timestamps and classifications of cough events. This SOP provides the
instructions that guarantee consistency in: (i) identifying expulsive
vs. vocal cough phases, (ii) distinguishing coughs from throat clears,
sneezes, or mechanical sounds, (iii) determining episode boundaries and
zoom-level expectations, and (iv) applying ambiguity and distance tags
uniformly. Because algorithm performance metrics (sensitivity,
specificity, PPV, etc.) are only as reliable as the annotations they are
compared against, the SOP ensures that human labeling itself is
validated, controlled, and standardized.</li>
<li>It Defines the Gold-Standard Methodology Used Across All Validation
Studies: As stated explicitly in the SOP (page 21), these annotations
serve as the “gold standard by which Hyfe’s algorithms are compared.”
This means: (i) Every validation dataset is created using the same
procedures. (ii) Inter-annotator variability is minimized. (iii)
Regulatory-grade reproducibility is ensured. Without this SOP, algorithm
performance would risk being evaluated against inconsistent or
subjective interpretations of cough sounds.</li>
<li>It Provides Traceability and Auditability Required in Pharma-Facing
Validation: Because this SOP is structured, version-controlled, and
includes a competency review, it supports: (i) traceable labeling
workflows, (ii) auditor-verifiable labeling practices, (iii) documented
human-factors controls, and (iv) clear justification for the reliability
of the ground truth used in accuracy studies. These characteristics are
essential for medical-device or pharma partners who require assurance of
methodological rigor.</li>
<li>It Reduces Systematic Error and Bias in Annotation: By defining what
a cough is, how it appears acoustically, and exactly how labelers should
mark it, the SOP reduces: (i) false positives from similar explosive
sounds, (ii) false negatives from subtle or distant coughs, (iii) bias
resulting from inconsistent zoom levels or labeling strategies. This
improves the quality of training and validation datasets, enabling more
accurate and generalizable algorithmic performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>This document is a core validation asset for Hyfe’s cough detection
system. It is not merely a labeling guide—it is a scientifically
grounded, operationally rigorous methodology for generating reliable,
reproducible ground truth, upon which all accuracy assessments,
performance claims, and regulatory-grade validations ultimately
depend.</p>
