of failure conditions: false positives and false negatives</h1>
<p>Data from <a href="(fda.html)">Hyfe’s clinical validation trial</a>
show that the Hyfe CoughMonitor Suite (CMS) performs strongly across
diverse real-world conditions, with accuracy varying naturally from
participant to participant. This variability is expected in any acoustic
sensing system and reflects two main factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Individual differences in cough acoustics, and<br />
</li>
<li>The wide range of everyday environments in which participants spent
time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, the trial included challenging, uncommon scenarios—such
as concerts, crowded indoor venues, power-tool use, loud kitchens,
open-window driving, and breathing-machine use—so that performance
statistics would reflect the full breadth of real daily living, not
ideal conditions. These rare environments were “baked in” to the
accuracy calculations, making the results conservative and strengthening
confidence in Hyfe CMS performance during normal use.</p>
<h2 id="false-negatives">False Negatives</h2>
<p>Missed coughs occurred in situations that are not typical for most
users, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very quiet coughs masked by extremely loud background noise (e.g.,
choir practices, group singing).<br />
</li>
<li>Highly atypical or unusual cough types (e.g., muffled or percussive
throat-clear–like coughs that differ from standard cough
acoustics).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="false-positives">False positives</h2>
<p>False cough detections were linked to a few specific, uncommon sound
types:<br />
- Laughter containing glottal bursts<br />
- Non-cough throat clears<br />
- Sharp, explosive household noises, such as dishwashing impacts</p>
<p>These sounds are infrequent in most day-to-day settings, and the
algorithm correctly handled them most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="overall-interpretation">Overall Interpretation</h2>
<p>Because Hyfe’s validation trial included high-noise, atypical, and
acoustically extreme environments, the accuracy metrics represent a
rigorous, real-world stress test rather than idealized performance. In
typical home and daily environments—where coughing usually occurs—the
CMS performs strongly and reliably, offering clinically meaningful
detection accuracy.</p>
<p>Clear labeling ensures that users understand the rare edge cases
where performance may vary, but the overall findings demonstrate that
the Hyfe CMS is a robust, high-quality cough monitoring system suitable
for real-world clinical and personal use.</p>
