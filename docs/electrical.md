# Electrical Safety Verification

The device used by the CoughMonitor Suite (CMS) has undergone rigorous, third-party electrical safety testing, according to **IEC 60601-1**, the global standard for basic safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment.

---

## Summary

* **Hyfe’s CoughMonitor PASSED all applicable IEC 60601-1 safety tests.**
* The device is **certified as safe** for its intended use as a **body-worn, internally powered, Type BF applied-part medical device**.
* Testing was performed by **TÜV SÜD PSB**, an accredited laboratory, under the Singapore Accreditation Council framework.
* No failures or safety-critical deficiencies were identified.

---

## Scope of testing

* **Standard:** IEC 60601-1:2005 + A1:2012 + A2:2020
* **Device tested:** Hyfe Cough Watch (same as CoughMonitor), Model H026
* **Testing period:** 8 April – 30 July 2025
* **Tested configuration:** Production-equivalent hardware, not a prototype

All required tests were performed, except for sections explicitly outside the manufacturer’s request (biocompatibility, usability, and EMC), which are covered under separate standards.
