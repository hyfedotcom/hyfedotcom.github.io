<h1 id="clinical-meaningfulness">Clinical meaningfulness</h1>
<p>Evidence of cough quantification’s clinical meaningfulness and
utility is growing, largely through independent investigations using
Hyfe’s technology.</p>

validation of an automated cough detection system in chronic cough.
European Respiratory Journal, 31(5), 1013–1018.
https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00057407<br />
- This foundational validation study established that an automated
24-hour cough monitoring device can reliably count coughs in chronic
cough patients<br />
- The Leicester Cough Monitor demonstrated high sensitivity (~91%) and
specificity (~99%) for detecting cough events and produced repeatable
cough frequency measurements<br />
- The authors concluded that objective cough counts provide a useful
clinical outcome measure for assessing cough severity and response in
clinical trials and longitudinal studies</p>

https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-2020-icc-003<br />
- This review outlines how technological advances have made objective
cough frequency an increasingly important measure in respiratory
disease<br />
- Hall et al. note that cough count is now the gold-standard primary
endpoint in clinical trials for new chronic cough treatments and has
been explored as a marker of tuberculosis infectiousness and as an
indicator of recovery in COPD exacerbations pubmed<br />
- They predict that improved automated detection (leveraging techniques
like speech recognition and ubiquitous mobile devices) will soon allow
cough counting to transition from a niche research tool into a widely
adopted method for clinical assessment and monitoring of respiratory
conditions.</p>

- Turner and Birring provide a comprehensive overview of cough
measurement techniques, emphasizing that objective cough frequency has
become a key outcome in clinical research, particularly serving as the
primary endpoint in trials of new anti-cough therapies<br />
- They explain that technology is enabling wider use of automated cough
counters, which complement traditional patient-reported measures (like
symptom scores and quality-of-life questionnaires) by providing
quantitative data on cough frequency<br />
- The review underscores that combining subjective and objective
measures offers a more complete assessment of a patient’s cough,
reflecting both the perceived impact and the actual cough frequency.</p>

public health: A scoping review. The Lancet Digital Health. Advance
online publication. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landig.2025.100908<br />
- Zimmer et al. conducted a scoping review of how objective cough
monitoring is used in patient care and public health. They identified
five key applications for cough counts — disease diagnosis, severity
assessment, treatment monitoring, health outcome prediction, and
syndromic surveillance — but found scarce evidence supporting each use
case to date.<br />
- The review noted moderate correlations between recorded cough
frequency and patients’ reported cough severity and quality of life,
suggesting that while cough counts capture clinically relevant
information, they do not always align with subjective symptom
experience.<br />
- The authors highlight the potential value of cough counting for
managing respiratory diseases, but also point out practical challenges
(device obtrusiveness, adherence, privacy concerns) and call for more
studies to validate and integrate cough counting tools into real-world
clinical practice.</p>

accuracy of the Hyfe CoughMonitor system: A multicenter clinical study.
Scientific Reports, 15, 880.
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-85341-3<br />
- In this multicenter study, Chaccour et al. validated a wearable
automated cough counter (the Hyfe CoughMonitor) against manual cough
counts. The device detected cough events with ~90% sensitivity and a
very low false-positive rate (~1 per hour), and its hourly cough counts
showed near-perfect correlation with human counters (Pearson r ≈ 0.99)
.<br />
- The results demonstrate that a non-intrusive, fully automated monitor
can reliably track cough frequency as patients go about their daily
activities. Given that cough is one of the most common medical symptoms
and is associated with outcomes in diseases like COPD and COVID-19, this
validated tool paves the way for incorporating objective cough counting
into routine clinical practice. The authors suggest that such technology
could improve diagnosis and treatment monitoring for chronic cough and
other respiratory conditions, helping clinicians objectively assess
cough severity and response to therapy.</p>
