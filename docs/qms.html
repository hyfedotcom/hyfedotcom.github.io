<h2 id="design-validation-quality-policy-within-hyfes-qms">Design
Validation &amp; Quality Policy within Hyfe’s QMS</h2>
<p>Hyfe’s approach to product validation and quality management is
grounded in a comprehensive Quality Management System (QMS) that
integrates industry standards, regulatory expectations, and internal
governance structures. Hyfe’s processes for validating its medical
technologies are rigorous, repeatable, and tightly aligned with
internationally recognized frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="design-validation-principles">Design Validation Principles</h2>
<p>The Design Validation procedure outlines a formal, controlled process
for demonstrating that Hyfe’s hardware and software products meet user
needs and intended uses through objective evidence. It explicitly
references external regulatory standards—including ISO 13485, IEC 62304,
21 CFR 820, and FDA validation guidance—signaling that validation
activities are embedded within a broader QMS consistent with global
medical device expectations. The document establishes defined roles,
responsibilities, and independence requirements, ensuring that
validation is led by qualified personnel, reviewed by QARA, and
independently assessed by knowledgeable reviewers. This structure
fulfills the V3+ principle of demonstrating that validation is
systematic, unbiased, and traceable.</p>
<p>The process descriptions reinforce the V3+ emphasis on
lifecycle-appropriate validation. Validation activities are tailored to
product risk, complexity, and intended use, ensuring that devices with
higher safety impact receive more extensive evaluation. The procedure
mandates that validation be grounded in documented user and product
requirements, not engineering assumptions, and that results be connected
back to those requirements through formal traceability. Formative and
summative elements appear in the planning, execution, deviation
handling, and reporting phases, providing clear checkpoints for
confirming that a product continues to meet expectations from early
development through formal release. This alignment with structured
evidence generation is foundational to V3+ verification.</p>
<h2 id="integration-into-hyfes-comprehensive-qms">Integration into
Hyfe’s Comprehensive QMS</h2>
<p>The Hyfe Quality Policy demonstrates organizational alignment behind
the QMS and the processes outlined in the Design Validation procedure.
The policy commits Hyfe to maintaining the highest standards of quality
across operations, emphasizing patient-centric innovation, regulatory
compliance, and continual system improvement. The extensive signatory
table—including executives from product, data science, medicine,
operations, and experience design—indicates that quality is not siloed
within QARA but is embraced company-wide. This broad accountability
structure is consistent with a mature QMS in which validation activities
are not administrative exercises but are central to product development
and risk management.</p>
<p>The Design Validation procedure further embeds QMS integration
through explicit references to related controlled documents, including
Design Reviews, Problem Resolution processes, Clinical Evaluation
procedures, Process Validation, and Change Control. This
interconnectedness shows that validation is not an isolated activity but
part of a cohesive system linking requirements, risk management, design
controls, and post-market updates. The requirement that all validation
plans, reports, and summary reports be stored in controlled QMS
repositories ensures traceability and audit readiness.</p>
<h2
id="evidence-of-organizational-control-and-regulatory-readiness">Evidence
of Organizational Control and Regulatory Readiness</h2>
<p>The structured planning and documentation requirements—such as
defining validation scope, acceptance criteria, personnel
qualifications, enabling systems, and statistical techniques—demonstrate
that Hyfe’s validation activities follow a disciplined, reproducible
methodology. The expectation that all deviations be documented and that
all validation activities be captured within Design Review meeting
minutes ensures transparency and control. The requirement for
independent review safeguards objectivity, while the use of controlled
templates (e.g., validation plans, validation reports, and summary
validation reports) promotes consistency across teams and product
lines.</p>
<p>The Quality Policy complements these operational controls by
articulating a shared commitment to excellence and patient impact. The
policy reinforces that quality is integral to Hyfe’s mission and not
merely a compliance obligation. The broad executive endorsement of the
policy illustrates top-level ownership of the QMS and confirms that
validation processes are supported by leadership across the
organization.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hyfe’s products undergo structured, risk-appropriate validation. This
ensures that user needs and intended uses form the foundation for all
verification activities; that documentation, independence, and
traceability are consistently maintained; and that quality is embedded
into the organization at every level. Hyfe has a comprehensive Quality
Management System including an explicit quality policy and design
validation protocol. These two documents are available below. Further
QMS documents are available upon request.</p>
