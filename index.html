<h2 id="verification-v1">Verification (V1)</h2>
<p>Verification ensures that the hardware and firmware of the device
correctly capture, store, and transmit the raw data they are designed to
collect—specifically, (i) acoustic signals containing cough (and
non-cough sounds), (ii) important events such as charging vs
non-charging, (iii) reflected light from the PPG sensor (used to
determine wear vs non-wear), and (iv) accurate timestamps associated
with the aforementioned elements so as to be able to appropriately
contextualize them.</p>
<p>Verification at Hyfe addresses whether the system meets its
engineering specifications and that its components work as intended. In
this phase, testing confirms that what the device captures is faithful
to the physical reality of the events (cough, charge, etc.) and states
(battery level, monitoring on/off, etc.) under a range of expected
operating conditions.</p>
<p>What follows are tests, experiments, and processes carried out by
Hyfe to verify the proper functioning of the system’s sensors and data
capture/storage/transmission capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="analytical-validation-v2">Analytical Validation (V2)</h2>
<p>Analytical validation determines whether the algorithmic detection of
coughs from raw audio is accurate, precise, and reliable compared to a
trusted reference (e.g., human-annotated audio). It asks whether the
digital measure— both event-specific detections and aggregated “number
of coughs per hour”—faithfully represents reality and behaves
consistently across users, devices, and environments. For cough, this
step evaluates algorithm performance (sensitivity, specificity, false
positives, robustness) and ensures the signal processing pipeline
translates verified inputs into valid, quantitative outputs. In short,
it proves that the measure itself is scientifically sound.</p>
<p>Analytical validation at Hyfe goes beyond just coughs. It also
includes the accuracy, precision, reliability, and generalizability of
both (i) the PPG-based wear vs non-wear algorithm, and (ii) the
motion-derived wear vs non-wear algorithm.</p>
<p>What follows are items of evidence pertaining to the analytical
validation of the algorithms used in the CMS.</p>

<h2 id="clinical-validation-v3">Clinical Validation (V3)</h2>
<p>Clinical validation tests whether the measurements generated by the
device are meaningful in the intended medical context—that is, whether
they reflect clinically relevant outcomes or changes in a patient’s
health. For a cough monitor, this means showing that measured cough
frequency correlates with disease severity, treatment response, or
quality of life, and that observed changes align with clinician or
patient perception. This phase confirms that the digital cough measure
provides actionable clinical insight, beyond mere technical accuracy,
and supports its use in patient monitoring or decision-making.</p>
<p>The following contains information on the clinical meaningfulness of
the CMS’ measurements.</p>

<h2 id="usability-validation-v3">Usability validation (V3+)</h2>
<p>Usability validation ensures that intended users can successfully and
safely use the cough monitor in the real world, under realistic
conditions. It covers human-factors engineering: setup, donning,
charging, syncing data, and understanding feedback—all without
introducing errors that compromise data quality or safety. For Hyfe’s
wrist-based device, this means confirming that typical users (patients,
clinicians, researchers) can wear and operate the device correctly,
leading to reliable data capture and analytical understanding with
minimal support.</p>

which forms the CMS is usable, acceptable, and scalable in its intended
population and context.</p>
